This page identifies web site conventions and is intended for content editors.

It is copied from [GDC Website](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/conventions-page)

## Web Site Grammar

*   Web Site content should be written in third-person (e.g. A researcher can...)
*   Spell out acronyms in the first reference to the acronym on a web page

## Web Site Punctuation

*   User only one space after each sentence (i.e. no double space after a period ".")

## Web Site Terminology

### General Terminology

*   Spell out the full organization name and/or program name followed by acronym in parentheses at the outset of a document or document section. After that point, use the acronym only without “the” in front of it. In general, “the” is not used before NCI or GDC. NCI GDC is not needed if content is posted on an NCI website. Use the possessive “NCI’s”  in a case such as “NCI’s goal is to provide genomic data…”, but using “GDC’s” is not appropriate. This form should not be used - there may be other ways to write content to avoid using this term.  (This guidance is from the NCI Office of Communications Public Laison - OCPL)

### GDC Tool Terminology

Use the following tool references

*   GDC Data Portal
*   GDC Data Transfer Tool
*   GDC Application Programming Interface for GDC API
*   GDC Data Submission Portal

## Web Site References

### Links

*   Use relative and not absolute links. For example, use "/node/1234" or "/conventions" and not "https://beta-edits-gdc.oirc.on.ca/node/1234" as deploying the site on different web domains will break the link. Broken links result in Section 508 compliance issues.

### Images

*   Always add an alt and description tag to images in support of Section 508 compliance

### Downloadable files

*   When linking to a downloadable content (PDF, images, etc.), it is good practice to indicate the format the file size of the content so the user knows what to expect.  Please see the sample page for a style example.
*   Downloadable files should have meaningful filenames so the user can find the file easily once downloaded.
*   PDFs and other text documents should be 508 compliant.

### Video/Audio

*   YouTube videos are embedded in webpages using IFRAMES.  The TITLE attribute is required for 508 compliance.

### Tables

*   Data tables need to be marked up correctly to be 508 compliant. See the following webpage for details: http://webaim.org/techniques/tables/data

### Div/Span

*   div/span tags should be avoided when used for lists, tables, and other structural aspects.  If you are developing using these tags, then you will need to test between web browser technologies and devices.
