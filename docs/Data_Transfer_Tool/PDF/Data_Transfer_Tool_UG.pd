## Getting Started with the GDC Data Transfer Tool

### Getting Started

#### The GDC Data Transfer Tool: An Overview

Raw sequence data, typically stored as BAM or FASTQ files, make up the bulk of data stored at The NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC) . The size of a single file can vary greatly. Most BAM files stored in the GDC are in the 50 MB - 40 GB size range, with some of the whole genome BAM files reaching sizes of 200-300 GB.

The GDC Data Transfer Tool provides an optimized method of transferring data to and from the GDC, and enables resumption of interrupted transfers. The tool's download and upload functionality is built upon a high-performance, UDP-based data transfer protocol known as [UDT](http://udt.sourceforge.net/), or User Datagram Protocol (UDP)-based Data Transfer. The UDT protocol is implemented in C++ for speed, but exposed via Python to provide a clean, user-friendly command line interface. The GDC Data Transfer Tool is also capable of performing TCP downloads for cases where UDP traffic may be blocked.

#### Downloading the GDC Data Transfer Tool

## Preparing for Data Download and Upload

### Preparing for Data Download and Upload

The GDC Data Transfer Tool is intended to be used in conjunction with the [GDC Data Portal](https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov) to transfer data to or from GDC. First, the GDC Data Portal&#39;s interface is used to generate a manifest file or obtain UUID(s) and (for controlled data) an authentication token. The GDC Data Transfer Tool is then used to transfer the data files listed in the manifest file or identified by UUID(s).

#### Obtaining a Manifest File for Data Download

The GDC Data Transfer Tool supports downloading of multiple files listed in a GDC manifest file. Manifest files can be generated and downloaded directly from the GDC Data Portal:

First, select the data files of interest. Click the *Cart* button in the row corresponding to the file of interest. The button will turn green to indicate that the file has been selected.

![GDC Data Portal: Selecting Files of Interest](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Transfer_Tool/Users_Guide/images/04-01_Data-Portal-Selecting-Files.png)
**GDC Data Portal: Selecting Files of Interest**

Once all files of interest have been selected, click on the *Cart* button in the upper right-hand corner. This will bring up the cart page, which provides an overview of all currently selected files. This list of files can be downloaded as a manifest file by clicking on the blue *Download Manifest* button.

![GDC Data Portal: Cart Page](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Transfer_Tool/Users_Guide/images/04-02-Data-Portal-Cart-Page.png)
**GDC Data Portal: Cart Page**

#### Obtaining UUIDs for Data Download

A manifest file is not required to download files from GDC. The GDC Data Transfer Tool will accept file UUID(s) instead of a manifest file for downloading individual data files. To obtain a data file's UUID from the GDC Data Portal, click the file name to find its detail page including its GDC UUID.

**GDC Data Portal: Detailed File Page**

#### Obtaining a Manifest File for Data Upload

The GDC Data Transfer Tool supports uploading multiple files listed in a GDC manifest file. A manifest file for a data bundle can be generated using the GDC Data Submission Portal.

To obtain a manifest file, first select a project from the dropdown menu in the top left corner of the GDC Data Submission Portal:

![GDC Data Submission Portal: Select Project of Interest](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Transfer_Tool/Users_Guide/images/04-04_Submission-Portal-select-project.png)
**GDC Data Submission Portal: Select Project of Interest**

Select a type of Data Bundle on the left; here we selected the *Lane Level Sequence* bundle type. In the middle pane you will see a list of data bundles in the project. Select a data bundle to be uploaded, and download the corresponding manifest file by clicking the link on the right:

![GDC Data Submission Portal: Detailed bundle page](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Transfer_Tool/Users_Guide/images/04-05_submission-portal-download-manifest.png)
**GDC Data Submission Portal: Detailed bundle page**

#### Obtaining an Authentication Token

The GDC Data Transfer Tool requires an authentication token to upload data to GDC and to download controlled data. Tokens can be generated and downloaded directly from the GDC Data Portal.

To generate a token, first log in to the GDC Data Portal by clicking the *Login* button in the top right corner of the page. This will redirect to the eRA Commons login page. After successful authentication, the GDC Data Portal will display the username in place of the *Login* button. Here, the user John Doe&nbsp;is logged in to the GDC Data Portal, indicated by the username JOHNDOE:

![GDC Data Portal Home Screen after Login](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Transfer_Tool/Users_Guide/images/04-06_gdc-data-portal-home-screen-after-login.png)
**GDC Data Portal Home Screen after Login**

Clicking the username will open a drop-down menu. Select *Download Token* from the menu to generate an authentication token.

![GDC Data Portal User Dropdown Menu](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Transfer_Tool/Users_Guide/images/04-07-data-portal-user-dropdown-menu.png)
**GDC Data Portal User Dropdown Menu**

**NOTE:** The authentication token should be kept in a secure location, as it allows access to all data accessible by the associated user.

## Data Download and Upload

### Data Download and Upload

#### Downloads


##### TCP and UDT Modes

The GDC Data Transfer Tool supports two download modes:

* **TCP mode** is the default mode. It provides broader compatibility with different network configurations, including configurations where UDP traffic is blocked. In TCP mode, the GDC Data Transfer Tool relies on the ubiquitous [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793) to download files.

* **UDT mode** uses a protocol known as [UDT](http://udt.sourceforge.net/), or User Datagram Protocol (UDP)-based Data Transfer. UDT was designed for high-speed networks and supports transfers of terabyte-size data sets across the globe. UDT offers improved speeds when transferring data over high-speed networks such as ESnet, StarLight, and Internet2. UDT also offers improved performance for network routes that experience long ping times (RTT) and/or packet loss, such as those that can occur between GDC's facilities in Chicago and a geographically remote location. UDT mode requires a network configuration that is open to UDP traffic, including an open UDP port 9000.

Both modes provide improved transfer speeds over browser-based HTTP(S) downloads, and enable resumption of interrupted transfers.

*__Note:__ GDC Data Transfer Tool's UDT mode is currently only supported for downloads on Linux systems. UDT support for uploads, and for OS X and Windows systems is under development.*

###### TCP Downloads

The following example is a GDC Data Transfer Tool command for downloading two files from GDC in TCP mode:

	> gdc-client download gdc_file_uuid1 gdc_file_uuid2


###### UDT Downloads

UDT mode is activated using the **-u** switch. The following example is a command for downloading two files from GDC in UDT mode:

	> gdc-client download gdc_file_uuid1 gdc_file_uuid2 -u


##### Downloading Data Using a Manifest File

A convenient way to download multiple files from GDC is to use a manifest file generated by the GDC Data Portal. After generating a manifest file (see Preparing for Data Download and Upload for instructions), initiate the download using the GDC Data Transfer Tool by supplying the **-m** or **--manifest** option, followed by the location and name of the manifest file. OS X users can drag and drop the manifest file into Terminal to provide its location.

The following is an example of a command for downloading files from GDC using a manifest file:

	> gdc-client download -m gdc_manifest_6746fe840d924cf623b4634b5ec6c630bd4c06b5.txt

##### Downloading Data Using GDC File UUIDs

The GDC Data Transfer Tool also supports downloading of one or more individual files using UUID(s) instead of a manifest file. To do this, enter the UUID(s) after the download command:

	> gdc-client download 22a29915-6712-4f7a-8dba-985ae9a1f005

Multiple UUIDs can be specified, separated by a space:

	> gdc-client download e5976406-473a-4fbd-8c97-e95187cdc1bd fb3e261b-92ac-4027-b4d9-eb971a92a4c3

##### Resuming a Failed Download

The GDC Data Transfer Tool supports resumption of interrupted downloads. To resume an incomplete download, repeat the download of the manifest or UUID(s) in the same folder as the initial download.

	> gdc-client download f80ec672-d00f-42d5-b5ae-c7e06bc39da1

##### Downloading Controlled Data

A user authentication token is required for downloading controlled data from GDC. Tokens can be obtained from the GDC Data Portal (see instructions in Section 4. Once downloaded, the token *file* can be passed to the GDC Data Transfer Tool using the **-t** or **--token-file** option:

	> gdc-client download -m gdc_manifest_e24fac38d3b19f67facb74d3efa746e08b0c82c2.txt -t gdc-user-token.2015-06-17T09-10-02-04-00.txt

Alternatively, the full token can be supplied in plain text using the **--token** or **-T** option.

#### Uploads

##### Uploading Data Using a Manifest File

GDC Data Transfer Tool supports uploading molecular data using a manifest file. The manifest file for a data bundle can be retrieved from the GDC Data Submission Portal, or directly from the GDC Submission API given a data bundle UUID. The user authentication token file needs to be specified using the **-t** or **--token** option.

	> curl -H "X-Auth-Token:$token" "https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/submission/CGCI/BLGSP/manifest?ids=460ad2fe-5a7f-4797-9e18-336d33e21444" >manifest.yml

	> gdc-client upload -m manifest.yml -t token.txt

##### Uploading Data Using a GDC File UUID

The GDC Data Transfer Tool also supports uploading molecular data using a file UUID. The tool will first make a request to get the filename and project id from GDC API, and then upload the corresponding file from the current directory.

	> gdc-client upload -i cd939bdd-b607-4dd4-87a6-fad12893932d -t token.txt

##### Resuming a Failed Upload

By default, GDC Data Transfer Tool uses multipart transfer to upload files. If an upload failed but some parts were transmitted successfully, a resume file will be saved with the filename *resume\_[manifest\_filename]*. Running the upload command again will resume the transfer of only those parts of the file that failed to upload in the previous attempt.

	> gdc-client upload -m manifest.yml -t token

##### Replacing Previously Uploaded Data

Previously uploaded data can be replaced with new data by deleting it first using the **--delete** switch:

	> gdc-client upload -m manifest.yml -t token --delete

#### Troubleshooting

##### Invalid Token

An error message about an &#39;invalid token&#39; means that a new authentication token needs to be obtained from the GDC Data Portal or the GDC Data Submission Portal as described in Preparing for Data Download and Upload.

##### dbGaP Permissions Error

Users may see the following error message when attempting to download a file from GDC:

	 403 Client Error: FORBIDDEN: {
	  "message": "You don't have access to the data: You don't have access to the data"
	}

This error message means that the user does not have dbGaP access to the project that the file belongs to. Instructions for requesting access from dbGaP can be found [here](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/access-data/obtaining-access-controlled-data/registering-and-working-era-commons-and-dbgap).

##### File Availability Error

Users may also see the following error message when attempting to download a file from GDC:

	403 Client Error: FORBIDDEN: {
	  "message": "You don't have access to the data: Requested file abd28349-92cd-48a3-863a-007a218de80f does not allow read access"
	}

This error message means that the file is not available for download. This may be because the file has not been uploaded or released yet.

##### GDC Upload Privileges Error

Users may see the following error message when attempting to upload a file:

	Can't upload:{
	  "message": "You don't have access to the data: You don't have create role to do 'upload'"
	}

This means that the user has dbGaP read access to the data, but does not have GDC upload privileges. Users can contact GDC User Support to request upload privileges.

##### File in Uploaded State Error

Re-uploading a file may return the following error: <q>File in uploaded state, upload not allowed</q>. To resolve this issue, delete the file using the **--delete** switch before re-uploading.

#####  UDT Download Times Out

If downloads work in TCP mode but time out in UDT mode, there may be a problem with the user's network configuration. UDT mode requires a network configuration that is open to UDP traffic, including an open UDP port 9000. Contact your network administrator for assistance.

* Fixed a bug where adding a new line to the end of an auth token would break the header for a request.

##### Known Issues and Workarounds

* On some terminals, dragging and dropping a file into the interactive client will add single quotes (' ') around the file path. This causes the interactive client to misinterpret the file path and generate an error when attempting to load a manifest file or token.
	* *Workaround:* Manually type out the file name or remove the single quotes from around the file path.
