# About the Data

## Overview

The GDC provides access to data from several cancer research programs including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET), and the Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI).

For all new programs and projects data sets added to GDC, the GDC Data Portal provides access to these submitted data sets, which comply with GDC’s data standards for biospecimen, clinical, and molecular data.

For additional information on current GDC supported programs, the following resources are available:

*   [TCGA Data Primer](https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/TCGA+Data+Primer)
*   [TARGET Data](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/using-target-data)
*   [CGCI Data](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/cgci)

## Data Access

### Controlled Access Data

The GDC provides access to open and controlled data.  Example of controlled access data include: genomic sequence, germline variants, SNP6 genotype data, and possibly certain clinical data elements depending on the program.

Access to controlled data is granted by program-specific Data Access Committees.  Anyone who wishes to download controlled access data from the GDC must follow the same set of steps required by NCBI for access to this data in dbGaP.  That is, an eRA Commons account must be obtained, and then access must be approved by the appropriate Data Access Committee.  Instructions for how to obtain authorization for controlled access data can be found at the following link: [https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/dbgap_request_process.pdf](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/dbgap_request_process.pdf)

To download Controlled Access data, users must login to the GDC Data Portal using an eRA commons username and password.  

### Open Access Data

The GDC Data Portal provides access to data that is publicly available.  Open access data includes all Level 3 data (somatic mutations, gene expression, protein expression), as well as most clinical and all biospecimen data elements.

Users can browse information in the GDC Portal without having to login.  Anything that can be seen without logging in is Open Access data or metadata.  

#### Logging In

While not required for public data access, a user may login using the ‘login’ button at the upper right side of GDC Data Portal opening screen. 

More details about [Authentication and Authorization](Authentication.md) can be found in a [dedicated section of the documentation](Authentication.md).

#### GDC Data Portal Display of Controlled and Open Access Data

All metadata displayed in the GDC Data Portal is open access.  When data files are displayed, there will be a column in the display that indicates whether the file is open or controlled access.

The ‘lock’ icon represents whether a file is controlled or open access.  It does not indicate whether a particular user has access to that file.  As mentioned above, if the ‘My Projects’ option is checked, then a user will only see files that they have access to.
