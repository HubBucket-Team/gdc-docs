The GDC <i>Data Dictionary</i> is a human and machine-readable document expressed in <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a> that describes GDC data entities and their underlying concepts, definitions, content, and relationships. To the extent possible, dictionaries are used in the GDC system to inform data
semantics, submission, query and search, and reporting. Each link on this page describes the dictionary for a defined GDC entity. The dictionary page contains a description or definition of the entity, properties that entity may possess, and definitions and values those
properties may assume. When defined, common data element public IDs and links to semantic data resources are supplied for terms and properties. GDC continues to establish the semantic basis for all of its entities and terms.
