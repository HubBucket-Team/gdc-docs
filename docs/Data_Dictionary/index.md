The [GDC Data Dictionary](http://gdc-docs.nci.nih.gov/Dictionary/viewer/) identifies the properties and accepted types or values for required, preferred, and optional data elements as well as their relationships.

# GDC Dictionary Key Features

## View Data Dictionary

The GDC [Dictionary Viewer](http://gdc-docs.nci.nih.gov/Data_Dictionary/viewer/) provides a view of the latest version of the GDC dictionary. The [Dictionary Viewer](http://gdc-docs.nci.nih.gov/Data_Dictionary/viewer/) provides the following features:

*   _Navigation within the dictionary_ - Users can navigate within the dictionary to view the descriptions and definitions of an entity, properties of the entity, and definitions and values of entity properties.
*   _Links to semantic resources_ - Common data element public identifiers are provided for terms and properties along with links to semantic data resources
*   _Ability to download templates for data submission_ - Users can download templates for GDC data submission in TSV or [JSON](http://json-schema.org/) format. Templates are autogenerated from data elements within the dictionary.

## Configure the Data Dictionary

The GDC data dictionaries are described in [YAML](http://yaml.org/). This allows the flexibility for adding new data elements to the dictionary for incorporating in GDC data submission templates.

## Create Project Specific Data Dictionaries

The GDC supports project specific data dictionaries allowing organizations to extend the core GDC data elements to support project specific needs.
