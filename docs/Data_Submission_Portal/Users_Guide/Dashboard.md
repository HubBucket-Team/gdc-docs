## Overview

The GDC Data Submission Portal Dashboard aims to provide details about a specific project.

The Dashboard contains various visual elements to guide the user through all stages of submission, from dictionary viewer to releasing a project.

## Project status

The top section of the dashboard is broken down into four widgets:

* __Cases with Clinical__: Details the number of cases for which clinical data have been uploaded.
* __Cases with Biospecimen__: Details the number of cases for which biospecimen data have been uploaded.
* __Cases with Experimental Data__: Details the number of cases for which experimental data have been uploaded.
* __Files Uploaded__: Details the number of files uploaded using the manifest. 

These widgets are constantly updated to reflect the current state of the selected project.

Clicking on "Details" opens a table view with more details.
