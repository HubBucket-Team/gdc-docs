# Homepage

## Overview

After [authentication](Authentication.md), users are redirected to a homepage. The homepage acts as the entry point for GDC data submission and provides submitters with access to a list of authorized projects, reports, and transactions.

Content on the homepage varies based on the user profile (e.g. submitter, program office).

## Projects

The projects section in the homepage lists the projects that the user has access to along with basic information about each. The button used to [release](Submit_Release.md) each project is located on this screen. For users with access to a large number of projects, this table can be filtered with the 'FILTER PROJECTS' field.  

Selecting a project ID will redirect the user to the [Project's dashboard](Dashboard.md).
