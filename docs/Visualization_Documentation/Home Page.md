# GDC Portal Home Page

The [GDC Portal](https://gdc-portal-staging.datacommons.io) home page is the entry way to accessing data in the Genomic Data Commons.

Data within the Genomic Data Commons is organized by project based on a primary site (i.e Brain), though can be narrowed down in a few ways listed below.

* __Projects__: The projects link directs users to the [Projects List Page](ProjectListPage.md), listing project-level information.

* __Repository__: The repository link allows users to see all data contained in the GDC and apply file/case filters to narrow down their search.

* __Human Outline__: The home page displays a human anatomical outline that a user may use to refine their search. Clicking on an associated organ will direct to a user to a listing of all projects associated with that primary site. For example, clicking on the human brain will show only cases associated with brain cancer.  This visualization also displays statistics on the number of cases associated with the primary site.
