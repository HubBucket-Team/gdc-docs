# Legacy Archive

## Overview

[![Legacy Archive Portal](images/gdc-legacy-portal-home.png)](images/gdc-legacy-portal-home.png "Click to see the full image.")

A section of the GDC Data Portal is dedicated to host unharmonized legacy data from repositories that predate the GDC (e.g. CGHub). Legacy data is not actively maintained, processed, or harmonized by the GDC. Legacy users are encouraged to migrate to harmonized datasets.

The GDC Legacy Archive can be accessed from the homepage of the GDC Data Portal as well as from the "GDC Apps" menu.

The GDC Legacy Archive contains a limited set of features of the GDC Data Portal:

* __Facet search__: Ability to look for legacy files or legacy annotations based on case, file and annotation facets.
* __File and Annotation tables__: List of all the legacy files and list of all the legacy annotations.
* __File and Annotation entity pages__: Information page for each legacy file and annotation.
* __Cart__:  The GDC Legacy Archive and the GDC Data Portal are separate systems with separate download carts.

### File Page

The file page of the GDC Legacy Archive is similar to the [file page of the GDC Data Portal](Data_View.md#file-entity-page), and may include additional information as described below.

#### Archive

If a file was originally produced as part of an archive containing many other files, the archive information (Archive ID and number of files in the archive) is displayed in the file properties and, if selected, the user will see a _'Files'_ view containing all other files in that archive.

#### MAGE-TAB

If the file was part of a MAGE-TAB archive, the whole archive can be downloaded from the file details page.
