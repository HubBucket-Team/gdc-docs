## Getting Started

### Getting Started

#### The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal: An Overview

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal User's Guide is the companion documentation to the [GDC Data Portal](https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/). The GDC User's Guide provides detailed information and instructions for using the GDC Data Portal.

The GDC Data Portal is a robust data-driven platform that allows users to search and download cancer data sets for analysis using modern web technologies. Key GDC Data Portal features include:

*   Data browsing by project, file, case, or annotation
*   Visualization allowing users to perform fine-grained filtering of search results
*   Data search using advanced smart search technology
*   Data selection into a personalized cart
*   Data download directly from the cart or from GDC Data Transfer Tool using a manifest

Additional descriptions of key GDC Data Portal features are provided in the section that follows.

#### Accessing the GDC Data Portal

The GDC Data Portal is accessible using a web browser such as Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Firefox at the following URL: [https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov](https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov).
When navigating to the site, the GDC Data Portal homepage is displayed.

[![GDC Data Portal Homepage](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-data-portal-homepage.png "GDC Data Portal Homepage")](images/gdc-data-portal-homepage.png "Click to see the full image.")

The GDC Data Portal allows download of open access data without requiring a user login. To retrieve controlled access data, users must have access to the controlled access data set through dbGaP and use the Login functionality on the top-right corner of the screen.

#### Key Features

##### Data Browsing

By browsing through the GDC Data Portal, users can obtain details about specific aspects of the data, such as the associated project, files, cases and annotations (explanatory comments about the data). For example, from a project page a user can view files or cases within the project. While users are browsing through the Data Portal, they can progressively add more elements to a cart for data download.

##### Visualization

The GDC Data Portal allows researchers to identify data they are looking for and narrow their search using multiple visualization mechanisms such as tables, charts, and plots. Whenever possible, cross-references are enabled so that users can dive into the data directly from a plot.

##### Data Searching

GDC Data Portal contains two primary mechanisms for searching data: 1) searching using filters (also called Facets) or 2) searching via advanced search technology and the advanced query language. When a user clicks on a Facet, the GDC smart search is automatically populated to help users get familiar with the advanced query language. At any time, when a need for a more specific query arises, users can switch to smart search and update their query with more specific filters.

##### Cart Facilities for Data Selection

While navigating and searching through the GDC Data Portal, researchers can add files to their cart. The cart provides some statistics about the files it contains to inform the user about the overall number and size of files the user will download through the cart.

##### Data Download

The GDC Data Portal provides two primary channels to allow users to download data from a cart:

1) Download directly from the browser (Cart Download) or

2) Download using the [GDC Data Transfer Tool](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/access-data/gdc-data-transfer-tool). The GDC Data Portal generates a manifest based on all the files selected in the Cart. This manifest can then be easily imported into the GDC Data Transfer Tool to execute the download. Note that users can download all files that are under the GDC open access policy as well as any controlled access files that they have authorization for through dbGaP. Please visit [Obtaining Access to GDC Controlled Data](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/node/8035/) for information on how to obtain authorization to access controlled data sets through dbGaP.

##### BAM Slicing

The GDC Data Portal allows BAM slicing. Users can submit their slicing request in [BED](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1) format and download only the requested slice of a BAM file.

#### Release Notes

The GDC Data Portal is regularly being updated with new features. The Release Notes sections of the documentation contains details about new features, bug fixes and known issues.

## About the Data

### About the Data

#### Overview

The GDC provides access to data from several cancer research programs including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET), and the Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI).

For all new programs and projects data sets added to GDC, the GDC Data Portal provides access to these submitted data sets, which comply with GDC’s data standards for biospecimen, clinical, and molecular data.

For additional information on current GDC supported programs, the following resources are available:

*   [TCGA Data Primer](https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/TCGA+Data+Primer)
*   [TARGET Data](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/using-target-data)
*   [CGCI Data](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/cgci)

#### Data Access

##### Controlled Access Data

The GDC provides access to open and controlled data.  Example of controlled access data include: genomic sequence, germline variants, SNP6 genotype data, and possibly certain clinical data elements depending on the program.

Access to controlled data is granted by program-specific Data Access Committees.  Anyone who wishes to download controlled access data from the GDC must follow the same set of steps required by NCBI for access to this data in dbGaP.  That is, an eRA Commons account must be obtained, and then access must be approved by the appropriate Data Access Committee.  Instructions for how to obtain authorization for controlled access data can be found at the following link: [https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/dbgap_request_process.pdf](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/dbgap_request_process.pdf)

To download Controlled Access data, users must login to the GDC Data Portal using an eRA commons username and password.

##### Open Access Data

The GDC Data Portal provides access to data that is publicly available.  Open access data includes all Level 3 data (somatic mutations, gene expression, protein expression), as well as most clinical and all biospecimen data elements.

Users can browse information in the GDC Portal without having to login.  Anything that can be seen without logging in is Open Access data or metadata.

###### Logging In

While not required for public data access, a user may login using the ‘login’ button at the upper right side of GDC Data Portal opening screen.

More details about Authentication and Authorization can be found in a dedicated section of the documentation.

###### GDC Data Portal Display of Controlled and Open Access Data

All metadata displayed in the GDC Data Portal is open access.  When data files are displayed, there will be a column in the display that indicates whether the file is open or controlled access.

[![GDC Data Portal Main Page](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Commons/images/gdc-data-portal-controlled-files.png)](images/gdc-data-portal-controlled-files.png "Click to see the full image.")

The ‘lock’ icon represents whether a file is controlled or open access.  It does not indicate whether a particular user has access to that file.  As mentioned above, if the ‘My Projects’ option is checked, then a user will only see files that they have access to.

## Authentication

### Authentication

#### Overview

Accessing the GDC Data Submission Portal requires eRA Commons credentials with appropriate dbGap authorization. See [Obtaining Access to Submit Data]( https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/submit-data/obtaining-access-submit-data) for more details.

Permissions are attached to each user account. Access can be granted to one or more projects. Those permissions will apply throughout the GDC Data Portal and GDC Data Submission Portal and will define how data is being displayed.

#### Authentication via eRA Commons

By Clicking on "Login", users will be invited to authentication through eRA Commons. If successful, the user will be redirected to the GDC Data Portal or GDC Data Submission Portal.

[![GDC Data Submission Portal splash page](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Commons/images/GDC_Submission_Login_eRA_Commons.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Login_eRA_Commons.png "Click to see the full image.")

#### GDC Authentication Token

A Token is required to upload data to GDC, as well as to download controlled-access files, using the GDC Data Transfer Tool or the GDC Application Programming Interface (API).

The GDC Data Transfer Tool is optimized for large transfers with multi-part upload and integrity checking, making it the most efficient tool for molecular data submission.

Tokens are strings of characters provided with every GDC call requiring authentication. A file containing a token can be obtained through GDC Data Submission Portal once your NIH eRA Commons account has been established. Your GDC account will be automatically established upon first login and you will see a drop down menu next to your user name.

##### Obtain a Token From GDC Data Portal

After successful authentication, users can obtain their Token be clicking on their username on the top right corner of the screen.

[![GDC Token Download from GDC Submission Portal](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Commons/images/GDC_Portal_Token_Download.png)](images/GDC_Portal_Token_Download.png "Click to see the full image.")

##### Obtain a Token From GDC Data Submission Portal

After successful authentication, users can obtain their Token be clicking on their username on the top right corner of the screen.

[![GDC Token Download from GDC Submission Portal](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Commons/images/GDC_Submission_Token_Download.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Token_Download.png "Click to see the full image.")

##### Using the Token

Each GDC API request must include a "X-Auth-Token" custom header.

**Example**:

```bash
export token=YOUR_TOKEN
curl -H 'X-Auth-Token:$token'  "https://gdcapi.nci.nih.gov/data/49ac8944-1468-456a-bb65-b08c7e24a97a"
```
In the example above, replace YOUR_TOKEN with the token downloaded from the portal.

##### Token Expiration

Tokens are valid for ninety days from the time of download. Using an expired token will result in a 401 HTTP error code:

```http
HTTP/1.1 403 FORBIDDEN{
   "error": "You don't have access to the data"
}
```
**NOTE**: Invalid credentials will result in a server error even if the resource is open access.

#### Logout from GDC

By clicking on logout, GDC will be redirected to an eRA Commons page, displaying the logout status.

#### Filtering and Searching

The GDC Data Portal provide three different means to search and navigate throughout available data:

* __Faceted Navigation__: By clicking on relevant items on the left portion of _'Projects'_ & _'Data'_ views, a user can filter down displayed elements. Customized facets can be added by user to expand the GDC Data Portal capabilities.
* __Advanced Search__: Provides access to advanced and complex queries using a purpose-built query language.
* __Quick Search__: Provide, from any place on the GDC Data Portal, a quick access to a specific entity (Project, Case, File or Annotation).

##### Faceted Navigation

Available on the left side of _'Projects'_ & _'Data'_ views, _'Faceted Navigation'_ enable filtering by selecting relevant data. Facets are attributes of the data that are being searched. Faceted Navigation filters the overall data set based on the set of Facets chosen.

_'Faceted Navigation'_ is composed by three elements:

* __Query facets__: used to select relevant data
* __Query Field__: showing filters currently being applied
* __Results__: showing filtered results corresponding to the query

[![Primary Site Facet](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-data-portal-primary-site-facet.png)](images/gdc-data-portal-primary-site-facet.png "Click to see the full image.")

__Note__: In facets, the end of each filter line contains a number. This number corresponds to the number of entities corresponding to this filter.

By clicking on an element, a filter is automatically applied. If the user clicks on multiple elements, an __OR__ filter will be applied and the query will be displayed at the top of the page.

The count (in grey cell) next to each Facet, indicates the number of results corresponding to the field.

[![Faceted Navigation Query](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-data-portal-facet-query.png)](images/gdc-data-portal-facet-query.png "Click to see the full image.")

By clicking on a query term will automatically remove the corresponding filter.

The above query could be translated to:

```
Return all projects where primary site is Kidney OR Brain and containing Data Type Clinical OR Gene Expression
```

The resulting set is displayed below the query.

[![Faceted Navigation resulting Set](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-data-portal-faceted-navigation-resulting-set.png)](images/gdc-data-portal-faceted-navigation-resulting-set.png "Click to see the full image.")

###### Add Facets

In the Data section of the GDC Data Portal, users can add Cases or Files facets by clicking the "Add" button on top right section of the component.

[![Add a Facet](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-data-portal-data-add-facet.png)](images/gdc-data-portal-data-add-facet.png "Click to see the full image.")

This will open a search window allowing the user to search for the field using its name or description.

## Projects

### Projects

#### Overview

The Projects view provides an overview of all the data contained in the GDC Data Portal, organized by Project.  Administratively, a _'Project'_ is a specific effort undertaken as part of an overarching Program. Many projects were set up to study one tumor type, so project names and disease names can often be the same, as is the case for TCGA data, but this is not always the case.

#### Projects Search

##### Overview

When accessing the Projects view, the initial screen will display a table summarizing the information about the cases (i.e. sample donors) and data types for which data is available for each project.  This table displays for each project, the number of cases, number of files of each data type contained in the GDC for that project, and total file size of all the files in the project. With no Facets selected, this view includes all GDC Data Portal data.

This view focuses on the number of cases available at GDC within each program and project. Each case will have multiple types of data associated with it. Selections in the facets allows filtering of the number of cases in each project to those that have associated data files relevant to any of the selected data types or selected experimental strategies.

[![Projects View, Main Window (Table View)](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-data-portal-project-page.png)](images/gdc-data-portal-project-page.png "Click to see the full image.")

Clicking on any cell in the Project View Table will display filtered results in the ‘Data’ view described in this documentation.

##### Available Facets

As mentioned previously in this documentation, the projects view offer the ability to filter results using facets. The following facets are available in the projects page:

*   __Project__: Projects are described above.
*   __Primary Site__: Originating or primary anatomic site of the cancer under investigation or review.
*   __Cancer Program__: Programs are overarching activities meant to fulfill a broad scientific objective.  As mentioned above, Projects fulfill more specific requirements within a Program.
*   __Disease Type__: type of cancer studied in the project.
*   __Data Category__: Kind of data contained in the file. Note that each of these data types may have subtypes, and that the numbers given in the table reflect the numbers of latest files for all subtypes of that data type.  Data Subtypes can be explored in Facets contained in the ‘Files’ tab in the ‘Data’ view described below.

    *   _Seq_ – Raw Sequencing Data
    *   _Exp_ – Raw Microarray Data
    *   _SNV_ – Single Nucleotide Variation
    *   _CNV_ – Copy Number Variation
    *   _SV_ – Structural Rearrangement
    *   _Meth_ – Methylation
    *   _Clinical_ – Clinical Data about the case, as well as Biospecimen data about the sample and aliquots
    *   _Biospecimen_ – Clinical Data about the case, as well as Biospecimen data about the sample and aliquots
*   __Experimental Strategy__: This describes NGS sequencing strategies or microarray technological platforms/array types and other experimental assays.

##### Graph View

Clicking the _'Graph'_ tab will display an interactive view of the data currently being displayed according to selected filters. The top number in each column representing the highest count of that type.

[![Projects View, Main Window (Table View)](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-projects-graph.png)](images/gdc-projects-graph.png "Click to see the full image.")

When a user mouse-over an element of the graph, the whole line corresponding to the project is automatically highlighted

[![Graph Mouseover](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-table-graph-mouse-over.png)](images/gdc-table-graph-mouse-over.png "Click to see the full image.")

This graph has been configured to be clickable, on the above example, clicking on the 'SV' element will automatically redirect the user to the Data view with the following filter applied:

[![Applied Filter](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-data-portal-applied-filter.png)](images/gdc-data-portal-applied-filter.png "Click to see the full image.")

#### Project Entity Page

Each project has its own entity page aimed at providing an overview of all cases, files and annotations available for the selected project.

[![Project Entity Page](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-project-entity-page.png)](images/gdc-project-entity-page.png "Click to see the full image.")

Clicking on various numbers will link to the corresponding search page (data or annotations) with filters already applied.

For example, if the cases link in the ‘Clinical’ row in the ‘Available Data’ Table is chosen, the user will see a case view with the appropriate filters already applied.

On the top right section of the screen, two download options are available:

* __Download Clinical JSON__: Downloads a list of all Cases associated with this project.
* __Download Biospecimen JSON__: Downloads Biospecimen data from all cases associated with this project.

## Cases and Files

### Data

#### Overview

The data view is the entry point to data searching on the GDC Data Portal, it provides access to all main features of the portal

The Data view is the main section used on the GDC Data Portal to search for data.

[![Data View](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-data-portal-data-view.png)](images/gdc-data-portal-data-view.png "Click to see the full image.")

This view focuses on the number of data files available at GDC. Selecting items from the Cases and Files facet will reduce the numbers of files displayed to those files which have all the selected properties. Note that in this view, when a choice is selected (for example, Copy Number Variation), other facets will change to hide properties that are incompatible with the selected choice (for example, when Copy Number Variation is selected in the Files: Data Type facet, only data subtypes relevant to CNV are visible in the Files: Data Subtype facet).

#### Cases and Files Search

##### Facets
Two types of facets are available, _'Cases'_ and _'Files'_ facets.

By default, the following __Cases__ facets are available:

* __Case__: Search for cases using barcode or UUID.
* __Primary Site__: Originating or primary anatomic site of the cancer under investigation or review.
* __Cancer Program__: Programs are overarching activities meant to fulfill a broad scientific objective.  As mentioned above, Projects fulfill more specific requirements within a Program.
* __Project__: See project section of the documentation.

The _'Advanced'_ button redirects to the advanced query page; this feature is detailed in the Advanced Search section of the documentation.

#### Case Entity Page

[![Case Entity Page](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-data-portal-case-entity-page-header.png)](images/gdc-data-portal-case-entity-page-header.png "Click to see the full image.")

The Case Entity page displays case details including the project and disease information, data files that are available for that case, and the experimental strategies employed.

A button is available, on the top-right corner of the page to add all files associated to this case to the cart.

[![Case Entity Page, Clinical and Biospecimen](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-data-portal-case-entity-page-footer.png)](images/gdc-data-portal-case-entity-page-footer.png "Click to see the full image.")

The Case Entity page also provides direct access to the Clinical information about that case, and the Biospecimen file associated with the samples collected from that case (if present).  These files can be downloaded using the links in this view.

#### File Entity Page

Clicking on a filename on the GDC Data Portal redirects to a dedicated page providing additional details about the file.

From there the file can be added to cart, downloaded directly, or if the file is a BAM, just a slice can be downloaded.

[![Files Entity Page](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-data-portal-files-entity-page.png)](images/gdc-data-portal-files-entity-page.png "Click to see the full image.")

More details about the file itself are provided in the upper section of the page.

In the lower section of the screen, the following tables provide more details about the file and its characteristics:

* __Associated Cases / Biospecimen__: Relation between this file and its case as well as between this file and any other file is also available in this page.
* __Workflow__: TO BE COMPLETED
* __Read Groups__: TO BE COMPLETED
* __Metadata Files__: TO BE COMPLETED
* __Downstream Analysis Files__: TO BE COMPLETED

If the file was originally produced as part of an archive containing many other files, the archive ID is displayed and, if selected, the user will see a _'Files'_ view containing all other files in that archive.

If the file was part of a MAGE-TAB archive, the whole archive can be downloaded from the file details page.  BAI sequence data index files are related to sequence data BAM files and will be displayed if relevant.

## Advanced Search

### Advanced Search

#### Overview

An advanced search allows, via Genomic Query Language (GQL), to use structured queries to search for files and cases.

[![Advanced Search View](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-data-portal-advanced-search.png)](images/gdc-data-portal-advanced-search.png "Click to see the full image.")

The advanced search provides more filters than the faceted search.

A simple query in GQL (also known as a 'clause') consists of a __field__, followed by an __operator__, followed by one or more __values__. For example, the following simple query will find all files in the "TEST" project:

```
cases.project.primary_site = Brain
```

[![Advanced Search Example](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-data-portal-advanced-search-example.png)](images/gdc-data-portal-advanced-search-example.png "Click to see the full image.")

Be aware that it is not possible to compare two fields (e.g. disease_type = project.name).

__Note__: GQL is not a database query language. For example, GQL does not have a `SELECT` statement.

##### Switch between 'Advanced' and 'Faceted' Search

A query created using 'Faceted Search' will be automatically translated to 'Advanced Search' (i.e. GQL) when clicking on the "Advanced" button.

However, a query created using 'Advanced Search' is not translated to 'Faceted Search'. From the advanced search, click on Basic and you will be redirected to a reset faceted search.

#### Use the Advanced Search

When opening the advanced search page (via the Data view), the search field will be automatically populated with facets fileters already applied (if any).

This default query can be removed by pressing "Reset".

Once the query has been entered and is identified as a "Valid Query", click on "Search" to run your query.

#### Auto-complete

As a query is being written, the GDC Data Portal will analyse the context and offer a list of "auto-complete".

##### Field Auto-complete

The list of auto-complete suggestions includes __all__ the fields authorized in the advanced search matching the user text input. The user has to scroll down to see more fields in the dropdown.

[![Field Auto-complete](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-data-portal-advanced-search-project.png)](images/gdc-data-portal-advanced-search-project.png "Click to see the full image.")

##### Value Auto-complete

The list of auto-complete suggestions includes top 100 values that match the user text input. The user has to scroll down to see more values in the dropdown.

The value auto-complete is not aware of the general context of the query, the system will display all available values in GDC for the selected field.
It means the query could return 0 result depending of other filters.

[![Value Auto-complete](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Portal/Users_Guide/images/gdc-data-portal-advanced-search-value.png)](images/gdc-data-portal-advanced-search-value.png "Click to see the full image.")

__Note__: Quotes are automatically added to the value if it contains spaces.

#### Setting Precedence of Operators

You can use parentheses in complex GQL statements to enforce the precedence of operators.

For example, if you want to find all the open files in TCGA program as well as the files in TARGET program, you can use parentheses to enforce the precedence of the boolean operators in your query, i.e.:

```
(files.access = open and cases.project.program.name = TCGA) or cases.project.program.name = TARGET
```

__Note__: Without parentheses, the statement will be evaluated left-to-right.

#### Keywords

A GQL keyword is a word that joins two or more clauses together to form a complex GQL query.

**List of Keywords:**

*   AND
*   OR

__Note__: parentheses can be used to control the order in which clauses are executed.

##### AND Keyword

Used to combine multiple clauses, allowing you to refine your search.

Examples:

* Find all open files in breast cancer

```
cases.project.primary_site = Breast and files.access = open
```

* Find all open files in breast cancer and data type is copy number variation

```
cases.project.primary_site = Breast and files.access = open and files.data_type = "Copy number variation"
```

##### OR Keyword

Used to combine multiple clauses, allowing you to expand your search.

__Note__: __IN__ keyword can be an alternative to OR and result in simplified queries.

Examples:

*   Find all files that are raw sequencing data or raw microarray data:

```
files.data_type = "Raw microarray data" or files.data_type = "Raw sequencing data"
```

*   Find all files where donors are male or vital status is alive:

```
cases.clinical.gender = male or cases.clinical.vital_status = alive
```

#### Operators

An operator in GQL is one or more symbols or words comparing the value of a field on its left with one or more values on its right, such that only true results are retrieved by the clause.

**List of Operators:**

+--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Operator                                   | Name                                                       |
+============================================+============================================================+
| =                                          | EQUAL                                                      |
+--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| !=                                         | NOT EQUAL                                                  |
+--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| <                                          | LOWER THAN                                                 |
+--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| <=                                         | LOWER THAN OR EQUAL                                        |
+--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| \>                                         | GREATER THAN                                               |
+--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| \>=                                        | GREATER THAN OR EQUAL                                      |
+--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| IN                                         | IN                                                         |
+--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| NOT IN                                     | NOT IN                                                     |
+--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| IS MISSING                                 | IS MISSING                                                 |

+--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

**Limitation**: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, Cannot be used with __text__ or __date__ fields.


##### "=" operator - EQUAL

The "`=`" operator is used to search for files where the value of the specified field exactly matches the specified value.

Examples:

*   Find all files that are gene expression:

```
files.data_type = "Gene expression"
```

*   Find all cases whose gender is female:

```
cases.clinical.gender = female
```

##### "!=" operator - NOT EQUAL

The "`!=`" operator is used to search for files where the value of the specified field does not match the specified value.

The "`!=`" operator will not match a field that has no value (i.e. a field that is empty). For example, `gender != male` will only match cases who have a gender and the gender is not male. To find cases other than male or with no gender populated, you would need to type gender != male or gender is missing.

Examples:

*   Find all files with an experimental different from genotyping array:

```
files.experimental_strategy != "Genotyping array"
```

##### ">" operator - GREATER THAN

The "`>`" operator is used to search for files where the value of the specified field is greater than the specified value.

Examples:

* Find all cases whose number of days to death is greater than 60:

```
cases.clinical.days_to_death > 60
```

* Find all cases whose year of diagnosis is after 2000:

```
cases.clinical.year_of_diagnosis > 2000
```

##### ">=" operator - GREATER THAN OR EQUALS

The "`>=`" operator is used to search for files where the value of the specified field is greater than or equal to the specified value.

Examples:

* Find all cases whose number of days to death is equal or greater than 60:

```
cases.clinical.days_to_death >= 60
```

* Find all cases whose year of diagnosis is in 2005 or later:

```
cases.clinical.year_of_diagnosis >= 2005
```

##### "<" operator - LESS THAN

The "`<`" operator is used to search for files where the value of the specified field is less than the specified value.

Examples:

*   Find all cases whose age at diagnosis is less than 400 days:

```
cases.clinical.age_at_diagnosis < 400
```

*   Find all cases whose year of diagnosis is before 1990:

```
cases.clinical.year_of_diagnosis < 1990
```

##### "<=" operator - LESS THAN OR EQUALS

The "`<=`" operator is used to search for files where the value of the specified field is less than or equal to the specified value.

Examples:

* Find all cases whose year of diagnosis is in 1990 or earlier:

```
cases.clinical.year_of_diagnosis <= 1990
```

*   Find all cases with a number of days to death less than or equal to 20:

```
cases.clinical.days_to_death <= 20
```


##### "in" Operator

The "`IN`" operator is used to search for files where the value of the specified field is one of multiple specified values. The values are specified as a comma-delimited list, surrounded by brackets [ ].

Using "`IN`" is equivalent to using multiple  `EQUALS  (=)`  statements, but is shorter and more convenient. That is, typing `project IN [ProjectA, ProjectB, ProjectC] `is the same as typing `project = "ProjectA" OR project = "ProjectB" OR project = "ProjectC"`.

Examples:

*   Find all files in breast, breast and lung and cancer:

```
cases.project.primary_site in [Brain, Breast,Lung]
```

*   Find all files tagged with exon or junction or hg19:

```
files.tags in [exon, junction, hg19]
```

##### "not in" Operator

The " `NOT IN` " operator is used to search for files where the value of the specified field is not one of multiple specified values.

Using "`NOT IN`" is equivalent to using multiple  `NOT_EQUALS (!=)`  statements, but is shorter and more convenient. That is, typing `project NOT IN [ProjectA, ProjectB, ProjectC] `is the same as typing `project != "ProjectA" OR project ! = "ProjectB" OR project ! = "ProjectC"`.`

The "`NOT IN`" operator will not match a field that has no value (i.e. a field that is empty). For example, `experimental strategy not in ["WGS","WXS"]` will only match files that have an experimental strategy **and** the experimental strategy is not "WGS" or "WXS". To find files with an experimental strategy different from than "WGS" or "WXS" **or is not assigned**, you would need to type: files.experimental_strategy in ["WXS","WGS"] or files.experimental_strategy is missing.

Examples:

*   Find all issues where experimental strategy is not WXS, WGS, Genotyping array:

```
files.experimental_strategy not in ["WXS","WGS", "Genotyping array"]
```


##### "is missing" Operator

The "`IS`" operator can only be used with missing. That is, it is used to search for files where the specified field has no value.

Examples:

*   Find all cases where gender is missing:

```
cases.clinical.gender is missing
```

##### "is not missing" Operator

The " `IS NOT` " operator can only be used with missing. That is, it is used to search for files where the specified field has a value.

Examples:

*   Find all cases where race is not missing:

```
cases.clinical.race is not missing
```

#### Special Cases

##### Using Quotes

A value must be quoted if it contains a space. Otherwise the advanced search will not be able to interpret the value.

Quotes are not necessary if the value consists of one single word.

* Example: Find all cases with primary site is brain and data type is copy number variation:

```
cases.project.primary_site = Brain and files.data_type = "Copy number variation"
```

##### Age at Diagnosis - Unit in Days

The unit for age at diagnosis is in **days**. The user has to convert the number of years to number of days.

*   Example: Find all cases whose age at diagnosis > 40 years old (40 * 365)

```
cases.clinical.age_at_diagnosis > 14600
```

##### Fields not Supported in the Advanced Search

The dates fields are currently not supported in the advanced search.

For example, a user cannot look for all the files which were created after January 1, 2015 (creation_datetime).


#### Fields Reference

The full list of fields available on the GDC Data Portal can be found through the GDC API using the following endpoint:

#### Overview

While browsing through the GDC Data Portal, files can be downloaded either individually or bundled through a cart mechanism similar to online stores.

The cart pages shows a summary of all files currently in the cart, display a file count by project and identified the authorization level of those files (controlled or open access).

#### GDC Cart

ADD MORE DETAILS

#### Download Options

From the cart, three different download options are available to the end user.

__Note__: when downloading multiple files from the GDC Data Portal, those files are automatically bundled-up into one single Gzipped (.tar.gz) file.

##### GDC Data Transfer Tool

The "Manifest for Fast Download Tool" button will download a manifest that can be imported into the GDC Data Transfer Tool.

The Manifest contains a list of the file UUIDs in the cart and can be used together with the GDC Data Transfer Tool to download all files.

Information on the GDC Data Transfer Tool is available in the [GDC Data Transfer Tool User’s Guide](/node/8196/).

##### Cart Download

The "Download Cart (web browser)" button will initial a data download directly from the browser. Users have to be cautious of the amount of data in the cart since this option will not optimize bandwidth neither provide resume capabilities.

##### Individual Files Download

Similar to the files page, each row contains a download button to download a particular file individually.

#### Access

If a user tries to download a cart containing controlled data and without being authenticated, a pop-up will be displayed to offer the user either to download only open access files or to login into the GDC Data Portal through eRA Commons.

## Release Notes

### Data Portal Release Notes

#### Release 0.2.18.3

* __GDC Product__: GDC Data Portal
* __Release Date__: November 23, 2015

##### New Features and Changes

* BAM slicing UI in the File Entity page (only available for BAM files with BAI files)

##### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* Disease Type does not auto filter (Data Facet)

##### Known Issues and Workarounds

* Missing pathology files and slide images for some TCGA datasets since they are not connected to the biospecimen chain yet
* In some specific situation (complex queries using must_not term), the advanced search might returns incorrect results
* When exporting the annotation table to a file, the create date field is not displayed in the same format than the UI
* In the advanced search, adding a trailing space to the query causes the UI to display a syntax error although the query is valid
* Checksum missing for MAGE-TAB files
* User can download large files (> 1GB) from the Portal but it fails when extracting the tar.gz file. User should use the GDC Download Transfer Tool for large downloads
* Authenticated user with access to TARGET projects cannot download Target DCC files. They will get a pop-up message.
* In Case Entity Page, the “Download Clinical XML" button is not applicable to TARGET projects. The label is incorrect but the functionality is accurate.
* The advanced search suggests more fields than expected (e.g. "cases.aliquots" should not be displayed). User should remove the field from the query and use the long field name (e.g. "cases.samples.portions.analytes.aliquots")
* If a user has previously logged into the Portal and left a session without logging out, if he comes back to the Portal after his sessionID expires, it looks like the user is still authenticated.
