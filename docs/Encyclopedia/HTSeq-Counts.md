# HTSeq-Counts #
## Description ##

HTSeq is a Python package that calculates the number of mapped reads to each protein-coding gene.

## Overview ##

The first step in gene expression quantification at the GDC is counting the number of reads mapped to each gene. This is performed by HTSeq and is performed at the gene level.  HTSeq-Count files are available in a tab-delimited format in which one column displays the 
Ensembl gene ID and the other displays the number of reads mapped to that gene.
