# HTSeq-Counts #
## Description ##

HTSeq is a Python package that calculates the number of mapped reads to each protein-coding gene.

## Overview ##

The first step in gene expression quantification at the GDC is generating a count of the reads mapped to each gene. This is performed by HTSeq and is performed at the gene level.  HTSeq-Count files are available in a tab-delimited format in which one column displays the Ensembl gene ID and the other displays the number of reads mapped to that gene.
