# Data Integrity #
## Description ##
Data integrity refers to the consistency and accuracy of data.  Maintaining data integrity means storage of data in an error free state and without unintended alteration.  
## Overview ##
Data integrity is an important aspect in modern computing.  Maintaining the completeness of data backups, databases, and file repositories is of great importance to both research settings and business systems.  Without methods and procedures in place to insure data integrity the data would be come unreliable and no longer of use in most environments.  
Data integrity is usually maintained at the hardware level and the software level, with policy procedures in place to assist with consistency at both levels.
