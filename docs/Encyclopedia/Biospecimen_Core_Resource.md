# Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR) #
## Description ##
A Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR) is a center where samples are carefully catalogued, processed, quality-checked and stored 
along with participant clinical information.
## Overview ##
The work of a BCR includes the following important functions:
* Serve as the interface between the program and the different Tissue Source Site (TSS) collecting tumor and matched normal controls
* Ensure and verify that TCGA human subjects protections and guidelines are adhered to and that all regulations are followed at each TSS 
* Verify use of language consistent with informed consent documents
* Examine all biospecimens to ensure they meet rigorous standards for each tumor type (including percent necrosis and percent tumor nuclei)
* Review pathology to ensure accurate diagnosis and validate against inclusion criteria
* Collect clinical information for each sample and apply standardized terminology, definitions and formats that are compliant with data standards
* Extract and distribute DNA and RNA from samples to genomic characterization and sequencing centers
