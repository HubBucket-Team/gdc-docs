# Variant Call Format #
## Introduction ##
The Variant Call Format (VCF) is a standardized format for storing and reporting genomic sequence variations.[1]
## Description ##
### Overview ###
VCF files are used to report sequence variations (e.g., SNPs, indels and larger structural variants) together with rich annotations. VCF files are modular where the annotations and genotype information for a variant are separated from the call itself. VCF version 4.1 is the currently active format specification.[1]
### Structure ###
The structure of the VCF is available in the [VCF 4.1 Specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.1.pdf). Changes made to the VCF in support of the GDC are available in the [GDC VCF Format document](https://gdc-docs.nci.nih.gov/Data/File_Formats/VCF_Format/).
