# Aligned Reads #
## Description ##
A read is a sequence obtained from a single sequencing experiment. Typically a read is produced when a base calling program interprets information from a chromatogram trace file produced from a sequencing machine.[1] An aligned read, is a sequence that has been aligned to a common reference genome.
## Overview ##
The GDC supports the submission of aligned reads, in addition to unaligned reads. A data file containing aligned reads is used as input to GDC workflows.
### Data Formats ###
Aligned reads are maintained in Binary Alignment Map (BAM) format.
