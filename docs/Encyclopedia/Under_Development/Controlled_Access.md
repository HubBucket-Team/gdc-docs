# Controlled Access #
## Description ##
Controlled Access data in the GDC is categorized as any data that may contain user identifiable information.  

## Overview ##
The NIH makes every effort to identify and safe guard the privacy of research participant's data.  In one of the many steps to achieving this goal data that may contain user identifiable data is restricted to qualify researchers who have requested access to the data sets.  This puts the data in a controlled or regulated state that is electronically accessible only by those that have been granted access.     

All data types are stripped of direct identifiers but data containing germline variants, SNP6 genotype data, raw sequenced data, or select clinical data elements may qualify for controlled access status.
