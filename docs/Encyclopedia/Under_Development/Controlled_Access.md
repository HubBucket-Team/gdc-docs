# Controlled Access #
## Description ##
Controlled Access data is data that may be unique to an individual. All data types are stripped of direct identifiers but data containing germline variants, SNP6 genotype data, raw sequenced data, or select clinical data elements may qualify for controlled access status.   
The controlled access data tier requires user certification.
