# Redaction #
## Description ##

A redaction occurs when cases are removed from the data prior to publication or release.

## Overview ##

Redacted cases are generally rare, but cases must be redacted when the subject withdraws consent, the TSS/BCR subject link is incorrect (“unknown patient identity”), or in the cases of genotype mismatch, when a sample is show to be from the wrong cancer, organ, or tissue. Redacted cases and their associated files are not displayed in the GDC Data Portal. Any questions about the redaction status of a case can be directed to GDC Support.
