# Representational state transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) #
## Description ##
A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.
## Overview ##
The GDC offers a RESTful API to the client that allows them access to perform all functions currently available on the data portals with the added bonus of accessing additional features like advanced queries to meta data, scripted data downloads, and submission function.  These extended features provide a multifaceted tool set to the researcher that can save time and bring data once only available in raw format no presented in a searchable data base format.
