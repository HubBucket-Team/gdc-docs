# Case #

## Description ##
A case is the collection of all data related to a specific subject in the context of a specific project.

## Overview ##

In the current GDC release, a case refers to a specific cancer patient in the context of a project.  However, future releases may contain cases that refer to non-patients such as cell lines. In the GDC Data Model, cases are associated with a project, the samples collected from the case, and the clinical data.

Cases serve are associated with all clinical data elements. Clinical and biospecimen supplements are also associated with cases. The case entity also serves as an API endpoint which allows for case-level data to be easily retrievable from the API.
