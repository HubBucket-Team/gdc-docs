# Manifest File #
## Description ##
A GDC manifest file is a file that is created by either the portal or API containing a list of files that the end user has requested.  
## Overview ##
When a user requests files from the GDC they are given the option to create a manifest file that can be used in conjunction with the Data Transfer Tool to retrieve them.  The manifest file contains the UUID, MD5 check sum, file size, and file name of each file located in it.
