# GDC Application Programming Interface (API) #
## Description ##
The GDC Application Programming Interface (API) is an external facing REST interface for querying and downloading GDC data, and submitting data to the GDC.
## Overview ##
The GDC API drives the GDC Data Portal, the GDC Submission Portal and is made accessible to external users for programmatic access to the same functionality found through GDC Portals. This includes searching, viewing, submitting and downloading subsets of data files, metadata, and annotations based on specific parameters.
