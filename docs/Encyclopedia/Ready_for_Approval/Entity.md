# Entity #
## Description ##
An entity in the GDC is a unique component of the GDC Data Model.

## Overview ##
The GDC Data Model is the primary method of organizing all data within the GDC.  More specifically, all the data within the GDC is based on a series of interconnected entities.  Examples of entities are cases, files, Biospecimen data, Clinical data, etc.  The GDC Data Dictionary defines the entities and the relationships between them.

Each entity is assigned a unique identifier in the form  of a version 4 UUID.

Data submitters can create and update submittable entities in the GDC Data Model and upload data files registered in the model using the GDC Data Submission Portal, the GDC API, and the GDC Data Transfer Tool.
