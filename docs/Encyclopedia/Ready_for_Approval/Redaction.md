# Redaction #
## Description ##

A redaction occurs when cases are removed from the data prior to publication or release.

## Overview ##

Because the GDC aims to make data available consistently, case redactions are generally rare and performed only in specific instances<sup>1</sup>. Cases must be redacted when the subject withdraws consent, the TSS/BCR subject link is incorrect (“unknown patient identity”), or in the cases of genotype mismatch, when a sample is show to be from the wrong cancer, organ, or tissue<sup>1</sup>. Redacted cases and their associated files are not displayed in the GDC Data Portal. Any questions about the redaction status of a case can be directed to GDC Support<sup>2</sup>.
