# HTSeq-Counts #
## Description ##

HTSeq is a Python package that calculates the number of mapped reads to each protein-coding gene.

## Overview ##

The first step in generating gene expression values from an RNA-Seq alignment at the GDC is generating a count of the reads mapped to each gene. These counts are performed using HTSeq and are calculated at the gene level. HTSeq-Count files are available in a tab-delimited format with one Ensembl gene ID column and one mapped reads column for each gene. These files are then processed further with custom scripts to generate [FPKM](HTSeq-FPKM.md) and [FPKM-UQ](HTSeq-FPKM-UQ.md) values.
