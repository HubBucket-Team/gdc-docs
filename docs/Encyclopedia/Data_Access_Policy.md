# Data Access Policy #
## Description ##
A Data Access Policy is an established control but in place to ensure that data protection requirements are adhered to.

## Overview ##
An data access policy is in place for data made available in the GDC to ensure that personally identifiable information is kept from unauthorized users. GDC access control policies adhere to the [National Institutes of Health (NIH) Genomic Data Sharing Policy (GDS) Policy](https://gds.nih.gov/03policy2.html) as well as the [NCI GDS Policy](https://www.cancer.gov/grants-training/grants-management/nci-policies/genomic-data). The GDC requires that users obtain authorization from the [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) for accessing controlled data.
