# GDC Data Submission Portal #
## Description ##
The GDC Data Submission Portal is a platform that allows researchers to submit and release data into the GDC.
## Overview ##
The GDC Data Submission Portal is a platform that allows researchers to submit and release data to the GDC. The key features of the GDC Data Submission Portal are:

* Upload and Validate Data: Project data can be uploaded to the GDC project workspace. The GDC will validate the data against the   GDC Data Dictionary.
* Review and Submit Data: Prior to submission, data can be reviewed to check for accuracy. Once the review is complete, the data can be submitted to the GDC for processing through   Data Harmonization.
* Release Data: After harmonization, data can be released to the research community for access through   GDC Data Access Tools.
* Download Data: Data that has been uploaded into the project workspace can be downloaded for review or update. Data can then be re-uploaded before it is released for access through   GDC Data Access Tools.
* Browse Data: Data that has been uploaded to the project workspace can be browsed to ensure that the project is ready for processing.
* Status and Alerts: Visual cues are implemented to easily identify incomplete submissions.
