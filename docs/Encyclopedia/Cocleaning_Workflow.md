# Cocleaning Workflow #

## Description ##

Cocleaning is the process in which DNA-Seq alignments are optimized by comparing paired tumor/normal samples. 

## Overview ##

DNA-Seq alignment cocleaning comprises two steps: Base quality score recalibration (BQSR) and indel realignment.  

### Tools ###

Both cocleaning steps are implemented using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK).
