# Aliquot #
## Description ##
An aliquot is pertaining to a portion of the whole; any one of two or more samples of something, of the same volume or weight.
## Overview ##
An aliquot can be a fractional part of a sample or analyte. Aliquots are typically the products shipped by a Biospeciman Core Resource (BCR) 
to a Genome Characterization Center (GCC) or analysis center. The [GDC Data Model](https://gdc.cancer.gov/developers/gdc-data-model/gdc-data-model-components) 
relates aliquots to samples and/or analytes for capturing the biospecimen information and read groups for associating experimental data.
