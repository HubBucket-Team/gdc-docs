# Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG) #
## Description ##
The National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG) unifies NCI's activities in cancer genomics by aiming to synthesize research in different fields of cancer genomics – structural, functional, and computational – to improve patient outcomes. CCG programs and collaborations generate cancer genomic and clinical data, and make these data available for widespread use by the research community.
## Overview ##
The NCI CCG established the GDC to provide the cancer research community with a data service supporting
the receipt, quality control, integration, storage, and redistribution of standardized cancer genomic data sets
derived from cancer studies.
