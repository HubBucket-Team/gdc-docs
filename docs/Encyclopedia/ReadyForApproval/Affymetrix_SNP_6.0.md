# Affymetrix SNP 6.0 #

## Description ##
Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 is a commercial SNP Array product by Affymetrix containing genetic markers, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and probes for the detection of copy number variation utilized for studying slight variations between whole genomes<sup>1</sup>.

## Overview ##
Data from the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 platform is used by the GDC to produce harmonized Copy Number Variation files<sup>2</sup>. Hybridization levels associated with Affymetrix SNP 6.0 probes are used to determine discrete chromosomal regions that show signs of duplication. A comprehensive documentation of the GDC Copy Number Variation pipeline can be found at the GDC Documentation Website<sup>2</sup>. A list of all probes and the chromosomal regions that associate with them (GRCh38 coordinates) can be found in the GDC Reference File webpage<sup>3</sup>.
