# Getting Started with GDC API
The GDC API is the external-facing REST API for GDC and drives the graphical interface of the GDC Data and Submission Portals. It is made available to external users for programmatic access to the same functionality provided by the portals. This includes searching for and downloading subsets of data files, metadata and annotations based on specific parameters and submitting files to GDC.

The GDC API uses JSON as its communication format, and standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.
## Tools
A large variety of tools are available to visualize and prepare calls to the GDC API.

The following tools can be used to communicate with GDC API (non-exhaustive list):

| Tool        | Type     |
| ------------- |-------------|
| [Curl](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) 		| Command line tool |
| [HTTPie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie) 	| Command line tool |
| [Postman REST Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client-packa/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en) 														| Google Chrome standalone app |
| [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) 	  | Google Chrome web browser can be used to make API calls |
| [DHC](http://restlet.com/products/dhc/)           | Google Chrome plugin to test REST APIs |

The following online tools can be used to help build GDC API calls:

| Tool        | Description     |
| ------------- |-------------|
| [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/)| Validate JSON strings |
| [UrlDecode.org](http://urldecode.org/)| Decode/Encode url strings (for example, from { to %7B) |

**Note:** See Appendix C for an example of using jsonlint and urldecode for GET to POST conversion.

| Endpoints | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **status** | Status | Get the API status and version information |
| **projects** | Search & Retrieval | Search all data generated by a project |
| **files** | Search & Retrieval | Find all files with specific characteristics such as file_name, md5sum, data_format and others. |
| **cases** | Search & Retrieval | Find all files related to a specific case, or sample donor. |
| **annotations** | Search & Retrieval | Search annotations added to data after curation |

## Status Endpoint
Before beginning work on the GDC API, test that it is responding by calling the status endpoint.```'https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/status'```

``` bash
    curl 'https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/status'
      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
    100    60  100    60    0     0   3264      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  3333
    {
      "status": "OK",
      "tag": "0.2.13-spr4",
      "version": 1
    }
```
## Versioning
The API has built-in versioning support to allow users to select which major API version to use.

When no API version is specified ```https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/<endpoint>```, the API will use the current production version of the endpoint.

The API version can be specified between the endpoint name and the API URL.```https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/<version>/<endpoint>```

>**Example:** Using the production version of the GDC API.

```
	https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/files
```

>**Example**: Using version 0 of the GDC API.

```
	https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/v0/files
```

## Request Headers
The GDC API supports the following request headers:

| Request Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Content-Type | Specify the format of the request payload (this is what the user is providing). Must be application/json or application/xml. |
| Accept | Specify the format of the response payload (this is what the user will get back). Must be application/json, application/xml. |
| X-Auth-Token | The submitterâ€™s authorization token as provided by the GDC Authorization API. This is the information that authenticates and authorizes the user to download controlled data or submit data. See [Obtaining a Token](#controlled-data-access) |
