# Getting Started

## The GDC Application Programming Interface (API): An Overview
The GDC API drives the GDC Data and Submission Portals. It is made available to external users for programmatic access to the functionality provided by the portals. This includes searching for, downloading, and submitting data and metadata.

The GDC API uses JSON as its communication format, and standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.

## Tools for communicating with the GDC API

Many third-party tools can be used for communicating with the GDC API and for preparing and visualizing API calls. The following is a non-exhaustive list.

Tools for communicating with the GDC API:

| Tool        | Type     |
| ------------- |-------------|
| [Curl](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) 		| Command line tool |
| [HTTPie](http://httpie.org) 	| Command line tool |
| [Postman REST Client](http://www.getpostman.com/) 														| App for Google Chrome and OS X |
| [DHC REST Client](http://restlet.com/products/dhc/)           | Google Chrome extension |
| [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) 	  | Google Chrome web browser |

Tools that can help build GDC API calls:

| Tool        | Description     |
| ------------- |-------------|
| [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/)| Validate JSON strings |
| [UrlDecode.org](http://urldecode.org/)| Decode/Encode URL strings |

**Note:** See [Appendix C](Appendix_C_Using_Third-party-Tools.md) for examples of using these tools.


## Making calls to the GDC API

Communicating with the GDC API involves making calls to API endpoints. Each endpoint corresponds to specific API functionality. The address of the latest version of a GDC API endpoint is `https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/<endpoint>`, where `<endpoint>` is the name of the endpoint. The address of an endpoint corresponding to a specific version of the GDC API is `https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/<version>/<endpoint>`, where `<endpoint>` is the name of the endpoint and `<version>` is the GDC API version.


``` Latest version
	https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/files
```

```	Call2
	https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/v0/files
```




``` Call1
	https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/files
```

```	Call2
	https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/v0/files
```



## Endpoints

GDC API functionality is available through the following endpoints:

| Endpoints | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **status** | Status | Get the API status and version information |
| **projects** | Search & Retrieval | Search all data generated by a project |
| **cases** | Search & Retrieval | Find all files related to a specific case, or sample donor. |
| **files** | Search & Retrieval | Find all files with specific characteristics such as file_name, md5sum, data_format and others. |
| **annotations** | Search & Retrieval | Search annotations added to data after curation |
| **data** | Download | Used to download GDC data |
| **slicing** | BAM Slicing | Allows remote slicing of BAM format objects |
| **submission** | Submission | Returns the available resources at the top level above programs i.e., registered programs |

## Status Endpoint
``` shell
    curl 'https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/status'
```
```python
import requests
import json

status_endpt = 'https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/status'
response = requests.get(status_endpt)
print json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2)
```
> Status Endpoint Output:

```json    
{
      "status": "OK",
      "tag": "0.2.13-spr4",
      "version": 1
}
```
Before beginning work on the GDC API, test that it is responding by calling the status endpoint.```'https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/status'```

Status Endpoints returns:

 - GDC API status
 - Build tag information
 - GDC API version


## Request Headers
The GDC API supports the following request headers:

| Request Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Content-Type | Specify the format of the request payload (this is what the user is providing). Must be application/json or application/xml. |
| Accept | Specify the format of the response payload (this is what the user will get back). Must be application/json, application/xml. |
| X-Auth-Token | The submitterâ€™s authorization token as provided by the GDC Authorization API. This is the information that authenticates and authorizes the user to download controlled data or submit data. See [Obtaining a Token](#controlled-data-access) |

## Response Headers
The API provides the following response headers

| Response Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Content-Type | Will be application/json or application/xml depending on the Accept header. |

## Status Codes
The GDC API can respond with the following codes:

| Status Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 OK | Success |
| 400 Bad Request | An entity or element of the query was not valid |
| 403 Forbidden | Unauthorized request |
| 404 Not Found | Requested element not found |
