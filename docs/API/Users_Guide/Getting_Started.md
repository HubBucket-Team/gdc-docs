# Getting Started with GDC API
The GDC API is the external-facing REST API for GDC and drives the graphical interface of the GDC Data and Submission Portals. It is made available to external users for programmatic access to the same functionality provided by the portals. This includes searching for and downloading subsets of data files, metadata and annotations based on specific parameters and submitting files to GDC.

The GDC API uses JSON as its communication format, and standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.

## Tools for communicating with the GDC API

A large variety of tools are available communicating with the GDC API and for preparing and visualizing API calls. The following are two non-exhaustive lists:

Tools for communicating with the GDC API:

| Tool        | Type     |
| ------------- |-------------|
| [Curl](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) 		| Command line tool |
| [HTTPie](http://httpie.org) 	| Command line tool |
| [Postman REST Client](http://www.getpostman.com/) 														| App for Google Chrome and OS X |
| [DHC REST Client](http://restlet.com/products/dhc/)           | Google Chrome extension |
| [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) 	  | Google Chrome web browser |

Tools that can help build GDC API calls:

| Tool        | Description     |
| ------------- |-------------|
| [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/)| Validate JSON strings |
| [UrlDecode.org](http://urldecode.org/)| Decode/Encode url strings (for example, from { to %7B) |

**Note:** See [Appendix C](Appendix_C_Using_Third-party-Tools.md) for examples of using these tools.

## Endpoints

The following endpoints are available for the GDC API.

| Endpoints | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **status** | Status | Get the API status and version information |
| **projects** | Search & Retrieval | Search all data generated by a project |
| **cases** | Search & Retrieval | Find all files related to a specific case, or sample donor. |
| **files** | Search & Retrieval | Find all files with specific characteristics such as file_name, md5sum, data_format and others. |
| **annotations** | Search & Retrieval | Search annotations added to data after curation |
| **data** | Download | Used to download GDC data |
| **slicing** | BAM Slicing | Allows remote slicing of BAM format objects |
| **submission** | Submission | Returns the available resources at the top level above programs i.e., registered programs |

## Status Endpoint
``` shell
    curl 'https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/status'
```
```python
import requests
import json

status_endpt = 'https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/status'
response = requests.get(status_endpt)
print json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2)
```
> Status Endpoint Output:

```json    
{
      "status": "OK",
      "tag": "0.2.13-spr4",
      "version": 1
}
```
Before beginning work on the GDC API, test that it is responding by calling the status endpoint.```'https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/status'```

Status Endpoints returns:

 - GDC API status
 - Build tag information
 - GDC API version

## Versioning
The API has built-in versioning support to allow users to select which major API version to use.

When no API version is specified ```https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/<endpoint>```, the API will use the current production version of the endpoint.

The API version can be specified between the endpoint name and the API URL.```https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/<version>/<endpoint>```

>**Example:** Using the production version of the GDC API.

```
	https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/files
```

>**Example**: Using version 0 of the GDC API.

```
	https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/v0/files
```

## Request Headers
The GDC API supports the following request headers:

| Request Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Content-Type | Specify the format of the request payload (this is what the user is providing). Must be application/json or application/xml. |
| Accept | Specify the format of the response payload (this is what the user will get back). Must be application/json, application/xml. |
| X-Auth-Token | The submitterâ€™s authorization token as provided by the GDC Authorization API. This is the information that authenticates and authorizes the user to download controlled data or submit data. See [Obtaining a Token](#controlled-data-access) |

## Response Headers
The API provides the following response headers

| Response Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Content-Type | Will be application/json or application/xml depending on the Accept header. |
