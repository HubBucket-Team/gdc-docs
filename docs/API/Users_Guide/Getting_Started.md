# Getting Started with GDC API
The GDC API is the external-facing REST API for GDC and drives the graphical interface of the GDC Data and Submission Portals. It is made available to external users for programmatic access to the same functionality provided by the portals. This includes searching for and downloading subsets of data files, metadata and annotations based on specific parameters and submitting files to GDC.

The GDC API uses JSON as its communication format, and standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.

## Endpoints

The following endpoints are available for the GDC API.

| Endpoints | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **status** | Status | Get the API status and version information |
| **projects** | Search & Retrieval | Search all data generated by a project |
| **cases** | Search & Retrieval | Find all files related to a specific case, or sample donor. |
| **files** | Search & Retrieval | Find all files with specific characteristics such as file_name, md5sum, data_format and others. |
| **annotations** | Search & Retrieval | Search annotations added to data after curation |
| **data** | Download | Used to download GDC data |
| **slicing** | BAM Slicing | Allows remote slicing of BAM format objects |
| **submission** | Submission | Returns the available resources at the top level above programs i.e., registered programs |

## Status Endpoint
``` shell
    curl 'https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/status'
```
```python
import requests
import json

status_endpt = 'https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/status'
response = requests.get(status_endpt)
print json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2)
```
> Status Endpoint Output:

```json    
{
      "status": "OK",
      "tag": "0.2.13-spr4",
      "version": 1
}
```
Before beginning work on the GDC API, test that it is responding by calling the status endpoint.```'https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/status'```

Status Endpoints returns:

 - GDC API status
 - Build tag information
 - GDC API version

## Versioning
The API has built-in versioning support to allow users to select which major API version to use.

When no API version is specified ```https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/<endpoint>```, the API will use the current production version of the endpoint.

The API version can be specified between the endpoint name and the API URL.```https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/<version>/<endpoint>```

>**Example:** Using the production version of the GDC API.

```
	https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/files
```

>**Example**: Using version 0 of the GDC API.

```
	https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/v0/files
```
