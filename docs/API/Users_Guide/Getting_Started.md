# Getting Started

## The GDC Application Programming Interface (API): An Overview
The GDC API drives the GDC Data and Submission Portals. It is made available to external users for programmatic access to the functionality provided by the portals. This includes searching for, downloading, and submitting data and metadata.

The GDC API uses JSON as its communication format, and standard HTTP methods like `GET`, `PUT`, `POST` and `DELETE`.

## Tools for communicating with the GDC API

Many third-party tools can be used for communicating with the GDC API and for preparing and visualizing API calls. The following is a non-exhaustive list.

Tools for communicating with the GDC API:

| Tool        | Type     |
| ------------- |-------------|
| [Curl](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) 		| Command line tool |
| [HTTPie](http://httpie.org) 	| Command line tool |
| [Postman REST Client](http://www.getpostman.com/) 														| App for Google Chrome and OS X |
| [DHC REST Client](http://restlet.com/products/dhc/)           | Google Chrome extension |
| [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) 	  | Google Chrome web browser |

Tools that can help build GDC API calls:

| Tool        | Description     |
| ------------- |-------------|
| [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/)| Validate JSON strings |
| [UrlDecode.org](http://urldecode.org/)| Tool for URL-encoding and URL-decoding strings, including JSON objects passed via URL |

**Note:** See [Appendix C](Appendix_C_Using_Third-party-Tools.md) for examples of using these tools.


## API Endpoints

Communicating with the GDC API involves making calls to API endpoints. Each GDC API endpoint represents specific API functionality, as summarized in the following table:

| Endpoint | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| status | Status | Get the API status and version information |
| projects | Search & Retrieval | Search all data generated by a project |
| cases | Search & Retrieval | Find all files related to a specific case, or sample donor. |
| files | Search & Retrieval | Find all files with specific characteristics such as file_name, md5sum, data_format and others. |
| annotations | Search & Retrieval | Search annotations added to data after curation |
| data | Download | Used to download GDC data |
| slicing | BAM Slicing | Allows remote slicing of BAM format objects |
| submission | Submission | Returns the available resources at the top level above programs i.e., registered programs |

The HTTP URL that corresponds to the latest version of a GDC API endpoint is `https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/<endpoint>`, where `<endpoint>` is the name of the endpoint.

The HTTP URL of an endpoint corresponding to a specific major version of the GDC API is `https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/<version>/<endpoint>`, where `<endpoint>` is the name of the endpoint and `<version>` is the GDC API version.

For example, the address of the latest version of the `status` endpoint is `https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/status`, whereas the address of the `status` endpoint corresponding to version 0 of GDC API is `https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/v0/status`.



## Making a request to the GDC API

The `status` endpoint provides information about the current status and version of the GDC API. The following are two examples of calling the status endpoint:


``` shell
    curl https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/status
```

``` python
	import requests
	import json

	status_endpt = 'https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/status'
	response = requests.get(status_endpt)
	print json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2)
```

Either of the above two commands returns an output similar to this:

	{
	      "status": "OK",
	      "tag": "0.2.13-spr4",
	      "version": 1
	}


## Request Headers
The GDC API supports the following request headers:

| Request Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Content-Type | Format of the request that the user is providing to the GDC API: `application/json` or `application/xml`. |
| Accept | Format of the response that the user expects from the GDC API: `application/json` or `application/xml`. |
| X-Auth-Token | The submitterâ€™s authorization token as provided by the GDC Authorization API. This is the information that authenticates and authorizes the user to download controlled data or submit data. See [Obtaining a Token](#controlled-data-access) |


## Response Headers
The API provides the following response headers

| Response Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Content-Type | `application/json` or `application/xml`; determined by Accept header of the corresponding request. |


## Status Codes
The GDC API can respond with the following HTTP codes:

| Status Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 OK | Success |
| 400 Bad Request | An entity or element of the query was not valid |
| 403 Forbidden | Unauthorized request |
| 404 Not Found | Requested element not found |
