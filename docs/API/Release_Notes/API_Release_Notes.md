## v1.1.0

* __GDC Product__: Application Programming Interface (API)
* __Release Date__: May 25, 2016

### New Features and Changes

* BAM index files (.bai) are now automatically downloaded with parent BAM.

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* None to report

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* Sorting by file `submitter_id` no longer causes an internal server error
* BAM index files are now included with harmonized BAM files
* Certain very long API requests will time out.  It is recommended to break up into a series of smaller requests.

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* Fields are not counted as missing if parent field is also missing.  This may occur with queries of nested fields in the Data Portal Advanced Search or an API query using a filter.  This behavior could impact results reported using search parameters of "IS MISSING" or "NOT MISSING".
* Certain very large API requests will time out.  It is recommended to break up very large requests into a series of smaller requests.
